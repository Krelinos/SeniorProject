# Microchip XML Graph Application Instruction Manual

This application requires the latest version of netbeans and java sdk to run with the ant build.
Once you have compiled the application, a new window will appear.

### Import graphs

This will allow you to import an xml file that you’d like to graph. You may also select multiple xml files at this time.

+ Click ‘File’ to select ‘Import Xml’, from here you will select the xml file(s) you wish to graph.


### Adjusting your line graphs

The xml file(s) are/is now located on the left hand side, where they appear as a list of layers. The order in which the layers are shown is also the priority at which they are displayed on the line chart.

+ If you want to change the order in which they’re displayed, click on the up and down arrow keys on your waveform and continue clicking until it is at your desired position in the list.



### Changing the color of the line graphs
From here you can now change the color of your individual line charts. All the graphs are currently the same color, black.

+ Click on the box with the black square. A color picker pop-up will be displayed, here you can select the color you want the graph to be. 

+ If you’d like to create a custom color, not shown in the picker, then click ‘custom color…’ to create a custom color for your line graph.




### Make graphs visible/invisible
This will make your line graph invisible or visible again, without deleting it from the list of existing graphs. By default all graphs are made visible with a check marked box on the right hand side of the graph layer.

+ Click on the rightmost box with the checkmark inside it to make it invisible, click again to make it visible again

+ If the line graph is not visible from the beginning, the box will instead be empty, click the box to make it visible again



### Removing line graphs
Remove line graphs from your list that you no longer need.

+ Click the ‘X’ button on the left hand side of the line graph layer to delete the graph from your list of graphs



### Naming line graphs
You can give each line graph its own name, so that you can better differentiate between them.

+ Click on the text box, ‘Waveform Name’, in the middle of the line graph layer and enter the desired name of the line graph



### How to export
An export option is available if you want to export the graph into an image(png or jpeg) or CSV file in excel, containing the Time(ps) and Current(A).

+ Click on ‘Export’ and ‘Image’, the File Explorer(Windows) / Finder(Mac) will pop-up, here you can type the desired name of the file 

+ You can also click on the drop-down menu, where the file type is, and choose between png or jpg format

+ To export data as CSV, click ‘Export’ and ‘CSV’, this will prompt you to type the desired name of the csv file



### Changing the background & default waveform color
By default the graph background color is white, but you can change the color to help your line graphs stand out against the background.

+ Click ‘Settings’ and ‘Fonts & Colors’, a pop-up window will appear with two drop-down menus

+ Click on ‘Graph Background Color’, you can now select any color provided or add your own custom color by clicking ‘Custom Color…’ (See image below)

+ To change the default waveform color, click on ‘Default Waveform Color’, where you can choose your desired color or add a custom one
